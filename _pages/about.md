I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Montreal (Canada). During my PhD, I have been a Visiting Researcher at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University. I am funded by the <a href="https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/">Fond de recherche du Québec Société et Culture (FRQSC)</a>.

Starting in the fall of 2023, I will be a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute.

I do research at the intersection of political opinion, geography and economy. I am also interested in questions on political behavior, group identity, and the political consequences of housing market. Methodologically, I have a keen interest for causal inference, experimental methods in social sciences and smart identification strategies.
