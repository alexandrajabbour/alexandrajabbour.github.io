    abstract = "Training datasets for semantic parsing are typically small due to the higher expertise required for annotation than most other NLP tasks. As a result, models for this application usually need additional prior knowledge to be built into the architecture or algorithm. The increased dependency on human experts hinders automation and raises the development and maintenance costs in practice. This work investigates whether a generic transformer-based seq2seq model can achieve competitive performance with minimal code-generation-specific inductive bias design. By exploiting a relatively sizeable monolingual corpus of the target programming language, which is cheap to mine from the web, we achieved 81.03{\%} exact match accuracy on Django and 32.57 BLEU score on CoNaLa. Both are SOTA to the best of our knowledge. This positive evidence highlights a potentially easier path toward building accurate semantic parsers in practice.",

Consequently, for small datasets, people usually use shallow and simple additional layers on top of pre-trained models during fine-tuning. This work shows that this does not always need to be the case: with proper initialization and optimization, the benefits of very deep transformers can carry over to challenging tasks with small datasets, including Text-to-SQL semantic parsing and logical reading comprehension. In particular, we successfully train 48 layers of transformers, comprising 24 fine-tuned layers from pre-trained RoBERTa and 24 relation-aware layers trained from scratch. With fewer training steps and no task-specific pre-training, we obtain the state of the art performance on the challenging cross-domain Text-to-SQL parsing benchmark Spider. We achieve this by deriving a novel Data dependent Transformer Fixed-update initialization scheme (DT-Fixup), inspired by the prior T-Fixup work. Further error analysis shows that increasing depth can help improve generalization on small datasets for hard cases that require reasoning and structural understanding.",

Log-likelihood is an appealing metric due to its grounding in statistics and information theory, but it can be challenging to estimate for implicit generative models, and scalar-valued metrics give an incomplete picture of a model’s quality. In this work, we propose to use rate distortion (RD) curves to evaluate and compare deep generative models. While estimating RD curves is seemingly even more computationally demanding than log-likelihood estimation, we show that we can approximate the entire RD curve using nearly the same computations as were previously used to achieve a single log-likelihood estimate. We evaluate lossy compression rates of VAEs, GANs, and adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Measuring the entire RD curve gives a more complete picture than scalar-valued metrics, and we arrive at a number of insights not obtainable from log-likelihoods alone.},

However, on discrete data such as text, it is unclear if unsupervised learning can discover similar latent space that allows controllable manipulation. In this work, we find that sequence VAEs trained on text fail to properly decode when the latent codes are manipulated, because the modified codes often land in holes or vacant regions in the aggregated posterior latent space, where the decoding network fails to generalize. Both as a validation of the explanation and as a fix to the problem, we propose to constrain the posterior mean to a learned probability simplex, and performs manipulation within this simplex. Our proposed method mitigates the latent vacancy problem and achieves the first success in unsupervised learning of controllable representations for text. Empirically, our method outperforms unsupervised baselines and strong supervised approaches on text style transfer, and is capable of performing more flexible fine-grained control over text generation than existing methods.},

  abstract={Variational autoencoders (VAEs) hold great potential for modelling text, as they could in theory separate high-level semantic and syntactic properties from local regularities of natural language. Practically, however, VAEs with autoregressive decoders often suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon where the model learns to ignore the latent variables, causing the sequence VAE to degenerate into a language model. In this paper, we argue that posterior collapse is in part caused by the lack of dispersion in encoder features. We provide empirical evidence to verify this hypothesis, and propose a straightforward fix using pooling. This simple technique effectively prevents posterior collapse, allowing model to achieve significantly better data log-likelihood than standard sequence VAEs. Comparing to existing work, our proposed method is able to achieve comparable or superior performances while being more computationally efficient.},

In this work, we propose a local discriminative neural model with a much smaller negative sampling space that can efficiently learn against incorrect orderings. The proposed coherence model is simple in structure, yet it significantly outperforms previous state-of-art methods on a standard benchmark dataset on the Wall Street Journal corpus, as well as in multiple new challenging settings of transfer to unseen categories of discourse on Wikipedia articles.},

Such failure hinders the application of deep learning based vision system in continual learning settings.

Our method, called Few-shot Self Reminder (FSR), regularizes the neural net from changing its learned behaviour by performing logit matching on selected samples kept in episodic memory from the old tasks. Surprisingly, this simplistic approach only requires to retrain a small amount of data in order to outperform previous methods in knowledge retention.

The adversary exploits compositionality of images and texts and is able to compose harder negatives through novel combination of objects and regions across different images for a given caption.

Our regularizer guides the rectifier discriminator D to better allocate its model capacity, by encouraging the binary activation patterns on selected internal layers of D to have a high joint entropy. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate improvements in stability and convergence speed of the GAN training, as well as higher sample quality.

Standard evaluation metrics have shown their remarkable speedup and prediction accuracy in test time, but their adversarial robustness remains unexplored even though it is an important security feature in deployment. We study the robustness of pruned neural networks under adversarial
attacks. We discover that although pruned models maintain the original accuracy,
they are more vulnerable to such attacks. We further show that adversarial training improves the robustness of pruned networks. However, it is observed there
exist trade-offs among compression rate, accuracy and robustness in adversarially trained pruned neural networks. Our analysis suggests that we should pay
additional attention to robustness in neural network pruning rather than just maintaining the classification accuracy.}

The former approaches are harder to interpret and suboptimal, whereas the latter cannot be applied to discrete input domains or to kernel functions that are not differentiable with respect to the input. The algorithm proposed in this work estimates an inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective. It can be used to optimize either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. Space and time complexity are linear in training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-of-art performance in discrete cases, competitive prediction results as well as a favorable trade-off between training and test time in continuous cases.}

 abstract = {We propose an efficient discrete optimization algorithm for selecting a subset of training data to induce sparsity for Gaussian process regression. The algorithm estimates this inducing set and the hyperparameters using a single objective, either the marginal likelihood or a variational free energy. The space and time complexity are linear in the training set size, and the algorithm can be applied to large regression problems on discrete or continuous domains. Empirical evaluation shows state-of-art performance in the discrete case and competitive results in the continuous case.},
